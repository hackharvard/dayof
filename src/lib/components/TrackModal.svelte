              CareYaya Health Technologies, a premier US Health-Tech startup, is funding
              transformative ideas in healthcare from top students at HackHarvard. Transform Health,
              a subsidiary of CareYaya Health Technologies, is a venture lab with a focus on
              generative AI and the impacts it can have on US health outcomes.

                We're challenging hackers to create a web-based application that will enhance the
                well-being and quality of life for elderly individuals.
              </b>
              Participants are encouraged to leverage open-source technologies and consider the feasibility
              of implementing the product in real-world scenarios. Bring your own idea, or focus on one
              of Transform's Pilot Innovation Projects (PIPs):

                &bull; ImmortalAI: Everyone has a story to tell, but not all stories are heard. With
                ImmortalAI, we're changing that by creating digital avatars that capture people's
                likeness and personality. By harnessing the latest advancements in generative AI, we
                transform a person's essence into a digital form that can interact with loved ones,
                share stories, and preserve memories. By joining us, you're not just working on a
                project; you're helping to keep stories alive for generations to come.

                &bull; DreamScape: Ever wonder what our dreams and thoughts would look like if they
                were images? DreamScape is on a mission to find out. Using a generative AI pipeline
                and Muse EEG collection, we turn the dreams and thoughts of elders suffering from
                dementia into visual experiences. This not only provides therapeutic benefits but
                also helps us better understand and stage Alzheimerâ€™s and dementia. By diving into
                the human mind with us, you're not just exploring unknown territories, but also
                bringing comfort to those grappling with memory loss.

                &bull; SkinGuard: Early detection can be a lifesaver, especially when it comes to
                skin cancer. SkinGuard makes this easier than ever by turning your cellphone into a
                powerful skin check tool. Simply snap a picture, and an app powered by the latest
                computer vision models will analyze it to assess the risk of Melanoma. This project
                is more than just a tech endeavor; it's a step towards a world where anyone can
                check their skin's health anytime, anywhere, providing peace of mind and promoting
                early detection. Your involvement could be the catalyst that saves lives.
